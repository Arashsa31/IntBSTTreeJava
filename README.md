Advance useage of a binary search tree
The height of a binary tree is the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node. Essentially, it is the height of the root node. Note that if a tree has only one node, then that node is at the same time the root node and the only leaf node, so the height of the tree is 0, similary, the height of a tree with only two nodes is 1. Implement this method to return height of the tree
